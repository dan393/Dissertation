# 
# ## The Data
# 
# We will be using a subset of the LendingClub DataSet obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club
# 
# ## NOTE: Do not download the full zip from the link! We provide a special version of this file that has some extra feature engineering for you to do. You won't be able to follow along with the original file!
# 
# LendingClub is a US peer-to-peer lending company, headquartered in San Francisco, California.[3] It was the first peer-to-peer lender to register its offerings as securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and to offer loan trading on a secondary market. LendingClub is the world's largest peer-to-peer lending platform.
# 
# ### Our Goal
# 
# Given historical data on loans given out with information on whether or not the borrower defaulted (charge-off), can we build a model thatcan predict wether or nor a borrower will pay back their loan? This way in the future when we get a new potential customer we can assess whether or not they are likely to pay back the loan. Keep in mind classification metrics when evaluating the performance of your model!
# 
# The "loan_status" column contains our label.
#

# # Missing Data
# 
# **Let's explore this missing data columns. We use a variety of factors to decide whether or not they would be useful, to see if we should keep, discard, or fill in the missing data.**

# **TASK: What is the length of the dataframe?**

# In[ ]:


# CODE HERE


# In[ ]:

# **TASK: Let's examine emp_title and emp_length to see whether it will be okay to drop them. Print out their feature information using the feat_info() function from the top of this notebook.**

# In[ ]:


# CODE HERE


# In[ ]:

# In[ ]:


# CODE HERE

df = df.drop('emp_title',axis=1)


# **TASK: Create a count plot of the emp_length feature column. Challenge: Sort the order of the values.**

# In[ ]:





# In[ ]:





# **CHALLENGE TASK: This still doesn't really inform us if there is a strong relationship between employment length and being charged off, what we want is the percentage of charge offs per category. Essentially informing us what percent of people per employment category didn't pay back their loan. There are a multitude of ways to create this Series. Once you've created it, see if visualize it with a [bar plot](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.23.4/generated/pandas.DataFrame.plot.html). This may be tricky, refer to solutions if you get stuck on creating this Series.**

# **TASK: Revisit the DataFrame to see what feature columns still have missing data.**

# In[ ]:


# CODE HERE


# In[ ]:


df['purpose'].head(10)


# In[ ]:

# **NOTE: This is one of the hardest parts of the project! Refer to the solutions video if you need guidance, feel free to fill or drop the missing values of the mort_acc however you see fit! Here we're going with a very specific approach.**

# **TASK: Find out what the mort_acc feature represents**

# In[ ]:


feat_info('mort_acc')


# **TASK: Create a value_counts of the mort_acc column.**

# In[ ]:


# CODE HERE


# In[ ]:


df['mort_acc'].value_counts()


# **TASK: There are many ways we could deal with this missing data. We could attempt to build a simple model to fill it in, such as a linear model, we could just fill it in based on the mean of the other columns, or you could even bin the columns into categories and then set NaN as its own category. There is no 100% correct approach! Let's review the other columsn to see which most highly correlates to mort_acc**

# In[ ]:





# In[ ]:


print("Correlation with the mort_acc column")
df.corr()['mort_acc'].sort_values()


# **TASK: Looks like the total_acc feature correlates with the mort_acc , this makes sense! Let's try this fillna() approach. We will group the dataframe by the total_acc and calculate the mean value for the mort_acc per total_acc entry. To get the result below:**

# In[ ]:





# In[ ]:


print("Mean of mort_acc column per total_acc")
df.groupby('total_acc').mean()['mort_acc']


# **CHALLENGE TASK: Let's fill in the missing mort_acc values based on their total_acc value. If the mort_acc is missing, then we will fill in that missing value with the mean value corresponding to its total_acc value from the Series we created above. This involves using an .apply() method with two columns. Check out the link below for more info, or review the solutions video/notebook.**
